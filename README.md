# Project 2 - Data Pagination & Filtering

## Project Details
* An array of student objects has been given
* A gallery of student profiles are displayed on the 
  webpage using that data
* The search field is used to filter out the student 
  profiles being shown based on the value the user types in. For example, if a user types in the letters 'ted', only students whose *first* or *last* name contains that value will show. If no students are a match, an 
  error message is shown
* Pagination links at the bottom help organize the amount 
  of student profiles being shown at any given page.
